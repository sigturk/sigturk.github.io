= The First Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Turkic Languages (SIGTURK 2024) August 15 2024, Bangkok (Co-located with ACL)

Proceedings: https://aclanthology.org/volumes/2024.sigturk-1/

== Introduction

We are excited to announce the First Annual Meeting of the ACL Special Interest
Group on Turkic Languages, held  in conjunction with https://2024.aclweb.org/[Annual Meeting of the
Association for Computational Linguistics] in Bangkok, Thailand.  Our primary
aim is to provide a new venue to foster research on computational linguistics
in Turkic languages.  By co-locating with ACL, we seek to facilitate
interaction among researchers from diverse backgrounds, encouraging the
exchange of ideas and the presentation of cutting-edge work in natural language
processing (NLP) specific to Turkic languages.

The main objectives of the workshop are:

* To construct and present a wide array of methodology and know-how, including foundational work for formulation and analysis of NLP models suitable for Turkic language processing.
* To provide a better understanding of how Turkic language typology may impact the applicability of current methods and motivate the development of novel methods that are more generic or competitive in Turkic languages
* Preparation of new corpora and resources in under-studied Turkic languages
* To build infrastructure by means of software libraries and benchmarks for developing NLP models that would accelerate progress in the field
* Promote collaborations across scientists from across the world that have specific interests in the study of computational linguistics in Turkic languages.

By supporting collaborations across research groups working on machine
learning, Turkic linguistics, and real-life applications of NLP tasks in
various languages, the ultimate goal of the workshop is to enlarge connections
across our community and allow rapid development of NLP methods and tools that
are applicable to a wide range of Turkic languages.
