FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS
---------------------

The First Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Turkic Languages (SIGTURK)
August 15-16 2024, Bangkok (Co-located with ACL)

INTRODUCTION

We present the first edition of the SIGTURK Workshop representing the
annual meeting of the ACL Special Interest Group on Turkic Languages,
which aims to provide a new venue that will promote studies on
computational linguistics in Turkic languages. Our main objective is to
bring together an interdisciplinary community of researchers working on
different aspects of natural language processing (NLP) models and
corpora in Turkic languages, providing the recently growing number of
researchers working on the topic with a means of communication and an
opportunity to present their work and exchange ideas.

TOPICS OF INTEREST

We welcome submissions on, but not limited to, the following topics:

-   Computational linguistics: models of all aspects of linguistics in
    Turkic languages (e.g., semantics, syntax, lexicon, morphology)

-   Systems: Case studies on the construction of NLP systems for Turkic
    languages

-   Evaluation: Understanding the applicability of current NLP methods
    in Turkic languages

-   Metrics: New metrics and measures for evaluating NLP systems
    suitable to Turkic languages

-   Learning from sparse data: Novel methods for learning from small or
    sparse data in Turkic languages

-   Resources: Datasets, benchmarks, and software libraries for NLP
    models in Turkic languages

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

Research papers

We invite all potential participants to submit their novel research
contributions in the related fields as long papers following the ACL
2024 long paper format (anonymized with 8 pages excluding the
references, and an additional page for the camera-ready versions for the
accepted papers). All accepted research papers will be published as part
of our workshop proceedings and will be presented either through oral
presentations or poster sessions. Our research paper track will accept
submissions through our own submission system available at
https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2024/Workshop/SIGTURK.

Extended abstracts

Besides long paper submissions, we also invite previously published or
ongoing and incomplete research contributions to our non-archival
extended abstract track. All extended abstracts can use the same EMNLP
template with a 2-page limit, excluding the bibliography. Extended
abstracts can be submitted to the workshop submission system using the
link: https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2024/Workshop/SIGTURK.

"HACK TOGETHER" PROGRAMMING EVENT

In addition to the workshop itself, the second day will be devoted to a
full-day collaborative programming event "Hack Together". Our goal is to
demonstrate the SIGTURK NLP library and interested parties can
contribute to the integration of new NLP methods and models into the
SIGTURK pipeline. The SIGTURK infrastructure can be found at
https://github.com/sigturk. Findings of the event will be combined into
a system demonstration paper.
