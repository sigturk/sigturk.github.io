As these processes involve sync and async communication, this document specifies professional standards all participants of SIGTURK and SIGTURK-related dialogue agree to uphold to promote formal reliability of SIGTURK outputs, respect, competence, responsibility, and integrity while recognizing the rapidly changing society and the necessity to exercise more considerable caution in this spirit by every participant.</description></item><item><title>Constitution</title><link>https://sigturk.github.io/constitution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sigturk.github.io/constitution/</guid><description>PDF version
I. TURKIC LANGUAGES Turkic language family includes approximately half a billion speakers around the world
Specially focused around the geographical range across the Eurasian continent
The status of recognition and formalization of the languages may range from national status to critically endangered
From the scientific perspective, the Turkic languages form a unique working ground, marked by a striking structural similarity, as well as an easily recognizable shared core vocabulary and inflectional inventory, which span the entire group of languages.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://sigturk.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sigturk.github.io/contact/</guid><description>For more information, please email sigturk.secretary [at] gmail [dot] com.

Domain experts play a crucial role—and ideally should be the primary decision-makers—in determining how scientific terms are translated into their native languages. In this work, we explore whether models can be developed to follow experts’ translation choices and automatically correct or post-edit translations accordingly.</description></item><item><title>SIGTURK 2024 Workshop</title><link>https://sigturk.github.io/workshop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sigturk.github.io/workshop/</guid><description>Proceedings: https://aclanthology.org/volumes/2024.sigturk-1/
Introduction We are excited to announce the First Annual Meeting of the ACL Special Interest Group on Turkic Languages, held in conjunction with Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics in Bangkok, Thailand. Our primary aim is to provide a new venue to foster research on computational linguistics in Turkic languages. By co-locating with ACL, we seek to facilitate interaction among researchers from diverse backgrounds, encouraging the exchange of ideas and the presentation of cutting-edge work in natural language processing (NLP) specific to Turkic languages.</description></item><item><title>SIGTURK 2024 Workshop</title><link>https://sigturk.github.io/workshop2024/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sigturk.github.io/workshop2024/</guid><description>Proceedings: https://aclanthology.org/volumes/2024.sigturk-1/
