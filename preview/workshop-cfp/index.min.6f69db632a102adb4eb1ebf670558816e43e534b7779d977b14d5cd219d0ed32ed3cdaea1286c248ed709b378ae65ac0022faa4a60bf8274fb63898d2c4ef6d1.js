TURKIC LANGUAGES   Turkic language family includes approximately half a billion speakers around the world\n  Specially focused around the geographical range across the Eurasian continent\n  The status of recognition and formalization of the languages may range from national status to critically endangered\n  From the scientific perspective, the Turkic languages form a unique working ground, marked by a striking structural similarity, as well as an easily recognizable shared core vocabulary and inflectional inventory, which span the entire group of languages. These features—despite a lack of mutual intelligibility—create a very special environment, in which researchers can naturally and readily appreciate shared problems and solutions in computational linguistics;\n     II.

Motions may be modified or withdrawn by their proposers at any time before the start of voting. All members of the SIG shall be notified promptly of all motions and modifications thereto, to permit discussion.\n Votes may be entered by electronic mail and votes arriving by the notified closing date will be counted by all officers in a public meeting. The voting period shall be at least three weeks, and the results shall be communicated promptly to the members.\n Any change to this constitution requires a two-thirds majority of those votes received from eligible voters and is subject to approval by the ACL.

Our main objective is to bring together an interdisciplinary community of researchers working on different aspects of natural language processing (NLP) models and corpora in Turkic languages, providing the recently growing number of researchers working on the topic with a means of communication and an opportunity to present their work and exchange ideas.\n The main objectives of the workshop are:\n   To construct and present a wide array of methodology and know-how, including foundational work for formulation and analysis of NLP models suitable for Turkic language processing.\n  To provide a better understanding on how Turkic language typology may impact the applicability of current methods and motivate the development of novel methods that are more generic or competitive in Turkic languages\n  Preparation of new corpora and resources in under-studied Turkic languages\n  To build infrastructure by means of software libraries and benchmarks for developing NLP models that would accelerate progress in the field\n  Promote collaborations across scientists from across the world that have specific interests in the study of computational linguistics in Turkic languages.\n   By supporting collaborations across research groups working on machine learning, Turkic linguistics, and real-life applications of NLP tasks in various languages, the ultimate goal of the workshop is to enlarge connections across our community and allow rapid development of NLP methods and tools that are applicable to a wide range of Turkic languages.\n   Topics of interest We welcome submissions on, but not limited to, the following topics:\n   Computational linguistics: models of all aspects of linguistics in Turkic languages (e.g., semantics, syntax, lexicon, morphology)\n  Systems: Case studies on the construction of NLP systems for Turkic languages\n  Evaluation: Understanding the applicability of current NLP methods in Turkic languages\n  Metrics: New metrics and measures for evaluating NLP systems suitable to Turkic languages\n  Learning from sparse data: Novel methods for learning from small or sparse data in Turkic languages\n  Resources: Datasets, benchmarks, and software libraries for NLP models in Turkic languages\n     Invited speakers   Kemal Oflazer, CMU\n     Important dates     Event Date     First call for papers\n February 7, 2024 (Wednesday)\n   Second call for papers\n March 4, 2024 (Monday)\n   Workshop Paper Submission Deadline\n May 31, 2024 (Friday)\n   Notification of Acceptance\n June 17, 2024 (Monday)\n   Camera-ready Papers Due\n July 1, 2024 (Monday)\n   Workshop Dates\n August 15-16, 2024 (Thursday-Friday)\n    Note: All deadlines are 11:59 pm UTC -12h (“anywhere on Earth”).\n   Contact information   Email: sigturk.secretary@gmail.com (TODO: change)\n  Submission Portal: https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2024/Workshop/SIGTURK\n  Official Website: https://sigturk.com/workshop\n     Submission guidelines Research papers We invite all potential participants to submit their novel research contributions in the related fields as long papers following the ACL 2024 long paper format (anonymized with 8 pages excluding the references, and an additional page for the camera-ready versions for the accepted papers). All accepted research papers will be published as part of our workshop proceedings and will be presented either through oral presentations or poster sessions. Our research paper track will accept submissions through our own submission system available at https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2024/Workshop/SIGTURK.\n  Extended abstracts Besides long paper submissions, we also invite previously published or ongoing and incomplete research contributions to our non-archival extended abstract track. All extended abstracts can use the same EMNLP template with a 2-page limit, excluding the bibliography.

Our goal is to demonstrate the SIGTURK NLP library and interested parties can contribute to the integration of new NLP methods and models into the SIGTURK pipeline. The SIGTURK infrastructure can be found at https://github.com/sigturk. Findings of the event will be combined into a system demonstration paper.\n   Awards A best paper award and winners of the shared task will be presented at the workshop and will be announced on our website.\n   Diversity and inclusion statement We are committed to promoting diversity and inclusion within our community. Part of our sponsorship funds are allocated to support participation from under-represented groups.\n   Workshop format The workshop will be conducted in a hybrid format, offering both in-person and virtual participation options.\n   Venue The workshop will be held in Bangkok, Thailand.
