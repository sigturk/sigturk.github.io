TURKIC LANGUAGES   Turkic language family includes approximately half a billion speakers around the world\n  Specially focused around the geographical range across the Eurasian continent\n  The status of recognition and formalization of the languages may range from national status to critically endangered\n  From the scientific perspective, the Turkic languages form a unique working ground, marked by a striking structural similarity, as well as an easily recognizable shared core vocabulary and inflectional inventory, which span the entire group of languages. These features—despite a lack of mutual intelligibility—create a very special environment, in which researchers can naturally and readily appreciate shared problems and solutions in computational linguistics;\n     II. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE The purpose of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) Special Interest Group on Turkic languages (the SIG) shall exist in order to:\n   Promote interest in the Turkic languages among practitioners of computational linguistics;\n  Provide members of the ACL with a community of special interest in Turkic languages with a means of exchanging news of recent research developments and other matters of interest in Turkic languages;\n  Publish and maintain language resources in Turkic languages;\n  Support, sponsor, facilitate and coordinate efforts related to organization of events, meetings, workshops and conferences to create collaboration opportunities for communities of researchers and scientists working on the Turkic languages;\n  Supporting and initiating projects on language resources and technologies serving Turkic-speaking communities;\n  Organise and make available funding and resources for specialist work;\n     III.

If you are interested in contributing to this project, please feel free to get in touch with us.\n   Future plans As a rapidly growing special interest group, we are aiming to start holding official meetings starting from 2023 to promote and accelerate progress in computational linguistics of Turkic languages. We also intend to keep refining our open and collaborative infrastructure, besides starting to build tooling that will help the Turkic NLP ecosystem have more interoperable modules with intermediate representations across language family members. We hope to see anyone interested in Turkic languages to be involved and participate in our future workshops.

Domain experts play a crucial role—and ideally should be the primary decision-makers—in determining how scientific terms are translated into their native languages. In this work, we explore whether models can be developed to follow experts’ translation choices and automatically correct or post-edit translations accordingly.\n   Subtask 1 – Term Detection Before correcting the translation of technical terms, we must first be able to detect them. The initial task, therefore, is to accurately identify the boundaries of these terms. Given the paragraphs and the sentences, the model should fill the term_pairs with the detected terms. To support contextual understanding, we also provide the corresponding source and target paragraphs.\n Data Format Example JSON instance:\n { \u0026#34;paragraph_id\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;sentence_id\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;source_paragraph\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Randomness is one of the most important parts of cryptography because key generation and the key itself depend on random values. In literature, there exist statistical randomness tests and test suites to evaluate the randomness of the cryptographic algorithm. Although there exist randomness tests, there is no mathematical evidence to prove that a sequence or a number is random. Therefore, it is vital to choose tests in the test suites due to independency and coverage of the tests used in the suites. Sensitivity of these tests to nonnandom data is also important. The tests should be classified to determine that tests are independent and wide.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;target_paragraph\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Rasgelelik kriptografinin en önemli kısımlarından biridir çünkü, anahtar üretimi ve anahtarın kendisi rastgele değerlere bağlıdır.

Evaluation is token-based: partial matches (e.g., detecting “key” instead of “key generation”) receive proportional credit. See the provided evaluation script for exact scoring details.\n    Subtask 2 – Term Correction with Expert Input In this subtask, the goal is to post-edit the translation of technical terms using expert-provided hints. Given the source and target paragraphs, corresponding sentences, detected term boundaries, and expert input (if available), the model must correct the translation of each term to conform to the expert’s preferred terminology.\n The system should fill the \u0026#34;correction\u0026#34; field for each term:\n   If no correction is needed, output \u0026#34;no-correction-needed\u0026#34;.\n  The field must contain only the corrected Turkish term (with appropriate suffixes if required).\n   This task focuses on evaluating the instruction-following capability of pretrained language models. Note that:\n   The provided hints may already represent the correct translation.\n  In some cases, the hint may appear without Turkish suffixes or as a partial translation.\n  Models should use the hint contextually and output a fluent, morphologically correct correction.\n   Data Format An example JSON entry with required corrections is shown below:\n { \u0026#34;paragraph_id\u0026#34;: 2, \u0026#34;sentence_id\u0026#34;: 5, \u0026#34;source_paragraph\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;In the early days of computing, programmers and developers shared software in order to learn from each other and evolve the field of computing. Eventually, the open-source notion moved to the way side of commercialization of software in the years 1970–1980. However, academics still often developed software collaboratively. For example, donald knuth in 1979 with the tex typesetting system or richard stallman in 1983 with the gnu operating system. In 1997, eric raymond published the cathedral and the bazaar, a reflective analysis of the hacker community and free-software principles.
